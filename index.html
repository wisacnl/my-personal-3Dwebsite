        <h2>📜 Manifesto</h2>
        <blockquote>
          "If you are not taking action, you are being acted upon." – Unknown
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        This belief drives us to take initiative in all our endeavors. We recognize that inaction can lead to missed opportunities and allow external circumstances to dictate our paths. Therefore, we commit to being active participants in our lives and communities.

        <h2>💻 Work History</h2>
        <h3><img src="vxi2.png" alt="Icon" style="width: 5%; height: 5%; vertical-align: left;"> VXI Global</h3>
        <p>
          I worked at VXI as a Technical Support Representative for one of their accounts from March 2022 until April 2023. I was able to use my knowledge in Cisco products in troubleshooting equipment issues as well as internet service problems.
        </p>
        <h3><img src="lexLogo.png" alt="Icon" style="width: 5%; height: 5%; vertical-align: left;"> LexMeet</h3>
        <p>
          I've experienced being a software engineer intern at LexMeet around August to October last 2023. It was a good experience as I learned more about their process in building web apps.
        </p>
        <h3><img src="accentureLogo.png" alt="Icon" style="width: 5%; height: 5%; vertical-align: left;"> Accenture</h3>
        <p>
          My experience as a software engineer intern at Accenture from July to September 2024 had been the best. They allowed me to be fully exposed inside their team. They also taught me how to use MS Power Apps among other things.
